# OnlineGuitarStoreWebsite
Headstock Guitars is a fictional online store that I have created for this assignment for uni.
The project consists of a website that stores data inside local storage variables.

Copy all of the files into a project in your IDE (Webstorm or Visual Studio Code for example).
Run index.html in a modern web browser (Chrome) from your IDE.
If you login/register and then add items to the basket/ pay, the data will be stored inside local storage variables.
Local storage is cleared when you log out.

All instrument images Â© Charvel, Fender and Ibanez and used for the sole purposes of education.
